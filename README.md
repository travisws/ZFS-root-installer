# ZFS-root-installer
WIP!!!

You will need to edit the script, as it is setup for my needs and some the tools I use.

This bash script is for installing ZFS as the bootable zraid root partition and using ZFSBootMenu. This is still a work in progress and right now setup for installing Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server.
